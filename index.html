    <h2>Day 1: Thursday December 12, 2024</h2>
    <p>Set up Daily Coding Journal Repo.</p>

    <h2> Day 2: Wednesday December 11, 2024</h2> 
    <p> Today I added an story to my readme doc. I added an html page. I read and learned about how others can contribute to my repo on copilate. I actually signed up for co-pilate and used it for the first time because Chatgpt was down - lol. Funny I just signed up for a paid sub on Chatgpt and now it's down - lol! Silver lining now I'm using co-pilate. I reviewed some docs about pushing, pulling, branching and merging. I also created an index.html page and an emmet scaffold! More tomorrow!!  </p>

    <h2>Day 3: Thursday December 12, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today I figured out how to reboot my live-server vscode extension. It stopped working unless I manually typed the npx live-server in the command line. I tried:

        <ol>
            <li>Making sure I had the latest versions of vscode and live-server by Ritwick Dey</li>
            <li>Disabling all extensions and bringing them in one at a time.</li>
            <li>Uninstalling and reinstalling live-server.</li>
            <li>Making sure live-server was set to google chrome.</li>
            <li>Making sure my computer was set to google chrome.</li>
        </ol>
        Although I did not really want to stop and figure this out as I had a small window to study today - I figured it be a good exercise in trouble shooting. It was rewarding in the end to come to a solution and learn about how extensions work.
    </p>

    <p>I also reviewed some materials on CSS styling. Tomorrow I hope to work a bit on my app and practice CSS as I'm assisting a cohort on CSS.</p>
