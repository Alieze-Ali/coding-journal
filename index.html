    <h2> Day 2: Wednesday December 11, 2024</h2> 
    <p> Today I added an story to my readme doc. I added an html page. I read and learned about how others can contribute to my repo on copilate. I actually signed up for co-pilate and used it for the first time because Chatgpt was down - lol. Funny I just signed up for a paid sub on Chatgpt and now it's down - lol! Silver lining now I'm using co-pilate. I reviewed some docs about pushing, pulling, branching and merging. I also created an index.html page and an emmet scaffold! More tomorrow!!  </p>
